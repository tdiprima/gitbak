# GitHub Backup

Back up all your repositories.

(I believe I modified backup-github.sh from [this script](https://github.com/tango-controls/GitHubBackup/blob/master/backup-github.sh).  Or you could check [The complete list of every GitHub backup script](https://rewind.com/blog/every-github-backup-script-complete-list/) ðŸ˜„)

The script has a mechanism to prune old backups based on their age.  It prunes files older than a specified number of days (`GHBU_PRUNE_AFTER_N_DAYS`).

## Usage

Use `./backup-github.sh`

Switch to the correct endpoint for users or organizations:

`GHBU_ORG_TYPE=${GHBU_ORG_TYPE-"users | orgs"}`

Export your github token:

`export GHBU_TOKEN=your_github_token_here`

## SSH Key

It is necessary to set up an SSH key to connect to GitHub.
